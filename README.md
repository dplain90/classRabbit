# README

classRabbit is a task requesting tool for teachers built with React, Rails, & Postgres - inspired by TaskRabbit. Teachers can request support on a variety of operational tasks and are matched with community members who would like to volunteer.

## Features

### Tasks & Categories

Users can create a task and search through task categories (ie Printing, Ordering).

### Taskers, Regions, & Availabilities

Taskers are workers who complete user provided tasks.

Users can view a curated list of taskers that are within proximity to their school. Additionally, they can filter taskers by date and time of day availability, number of reviews, and price.

## Future Improvements
* Interface for Tasker Sign Up
* Tasker/User Chat Interface
